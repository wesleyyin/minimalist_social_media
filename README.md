^I am still looking into renaming the image to match the post id, so the client can access the img given a reference to the post

change of plans, the stored image id should be the post object id+the original file name, to maintain the extension

//ok I'm still tweaking on this, maybe just implement more of the project first so I can properly tinker with this

^look into sending the desired name as a feild in the req

Retrieve img on client directly from fs location given post info(id)
